#### Abstract
A traditional presence management system consists of a magnetic card reader and users that use 
these magnetic cards to check in and check out at the work place. These type of systems may be 
more or less complex to use, and the initial cost is usually very high, which makes the system 
updates or changes very difficult.

Using current technologies, which are used extensively at the workplace and outside it, it is 
possible to create an alternative to the traditional system that is intuitive and inexpensive so that 
it is accessible to any type of organization.

The proposal made in this project is to utilize mobile phone technology, particularly new types 
of mobile devices, the so called smartphones, to create this alternative. The principle of operation 
of the new system is to use the mobile device to identify the user and a wireless network to 
determine that the user is physically at the job.

The project consists of implementing the various components that are necessary for the operation 
of a system such as that described above. These components are a web application and a mobile 
application for Android devices.

The web application distinguishes between workers and admin users. Worker users can check 
their recent activity, edit their personal data and generate activity reports. Administrator users 
can see the overall activity in the system, manage users and create custom reports for each user.
The mobile application allows worker users to perform presence management tasks (check in, 
check out, incidence) and query data on their activity from their terminal.
The project was developed so that the result is an expandable framework that the developer 
community can take and extend to adjust to their needs.

#### Installation
